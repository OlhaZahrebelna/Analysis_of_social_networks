## Analysis of Social Networks

This project looks at how people or groups are connected in social networks. It uses real data and Python code to find important people, small communities, and how the network is built.

## About This Project

The goal of this project is to study social networks using graphs. A graph shows people (as points) and their connections (as lines). We use Python to look at the network and find useful information.

What It Does

* Loads and prepares data for the network
* Calculates:

How many connections each person has

Who is most important in the network

How groups are formed
